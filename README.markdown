# WebFaction Private Application Stack
The shell script `webfaction.sh` will automatically build and configure your own
private **Ruby on Rails** stack. It was written with **[WebFaction](http://zownir.net/webfaction)**
users in mind, but is fairly generic. The directories `$HOME/logs/user` and
`$HOME/webapps/$APP_NAME` are assumed to exist.

## What's Provided
* Git 1.8.5.2
* SQLite3 3.8.2
* Your choice of Ruby 2.1.0 or latest Ruby from the 2.1 subversion branch
* Latest RubyGems
* Gems: rack, rails, thin, unicorn, passenger, capistrano, sqlite3-ruby, mysql
* nginx 1.5.8 (with nginx-upstream-fair module for fair load balancing and
  passenger module)
* Monit 5.6
* Startup scripts and working default configuration files for monit and nginx

## Options
You have the choice of running with passenger or a thin cluster. Passenger is
the default. You will have to follow a few extra steps to run thin. See below.

## Before Running the Script
1. Create a rails app from the WebFaction control panel. Leave the autostart
   box unchecked.
2. Create an app of type "custom application (listing on port)" from the
   WebFaction control panel. Name it monit.
3. Assign values to the four variables at the beginning of the script:
   `PREFIX`, `APP_NAME`, `APP_PORT`, and `MONIT_PORT`.
     * `PREFIX` is the installation path prefix. It is the location of your
       "private application environment". It should be somewhere in your home
       directory. It has a default value of `$HOME/apps`. You could make it
       `$HOME`, but the home directory contains things that are better off
       separate. With a compartmentalized `PREFIX` like `$HOME/apps`, if you
       aren't happy with your setup, you could simply kill the application
       processes, execute `rm -rf $HOME/apps` and start over fresh.
     * `APP_NAME` is the name of the app created in step one. The path
       `$HOME/webapps/$APP_NAME` should exist and contain at least a skeleton
       app. The default value for `APP_NAME` is `myrailsapp`.
     * `APP_PORT` is the port WebFaction assigned to the app created in step
       one. The default value is `4000`.
     * `MONIT_PORT` is the port WebFaction assigned to the app created in step
       two. The default value is `4002`.
4. If you want to install Ruby 1.9.3 from the official subversion repository,
   edit line 12 of the script to read `export RUBYSVN=true`

## After Running the Script
If no errors occurred, your rails app will be up and running in the production
environment. Of course, `$HOME/webapps/$APP_NAME` must contain a valid app for
this to happen, even if it's just a skeleton.

By default, passenger serves the app. This can be easily changed so that two
thin instances are set up listening on unix sockets with nginx as the fair load
balancing reverse proxy. Monit watches nginx (and the thin servers, if set up).
A crontab entry ensures that your setup springs back to life when the server is
rebooted.

There are a couple of optional things you should do:

1. Inspect the nginx and monit conf files to learn how they work.
   Modify them as you like.
2. Generate ssl certificates and create an nginx https vhost following my
   example file if you have a dedicated IP address for https traffic.

## Switching to thin
If you want to use thin instead of passenger:

Move the thin nginx vhost into place.

	mv $PREFIX/etc/nginx/vhosts/$APP_NAME.conf $PREFIX/etc/nginx/vhosts/$APP_NAME-passenger.conf.example
	mv $PREFIX/etc/nginx/vhosts/$APP_NAME-thin.conf.example $PREFIX/etc/nginx/vhosts/$APP_NAME.conf

Move the thin monitrc file into place.

	mv $PREFIX/etc/monit/$APP_NAME.monitrc.example $PREFIX/etc/monit/$APP_NAME.monitrc

Reinitialize monit and restart all processes...
	
	monit reload
	monit restart all

To reclaim idle memory, you can prevent passenger processes from starting up
with nginx. You have to manually edit `$PREFIX/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Comment
out the passenger directives: `passenger_root` (most importantly), `passenger_ruby`,
`passenger_max_pool_size`, and any others you add.

Also make sure that the upstream thin directive is uncommented in the nginx.conf
file. I didn't comment it out to begin with because it doesn't do any harm.

## Other Notes
Although the passenger stack uses less memory, the reported rss is probably higher.
This is because of multiple counting. Depending on how WebFaction meters memory
usage, this could be a practical downside.

To compare total rss with total private dirty rss (a better measure of actual
memory usage) run these commands:

	ps -u $USER -o rss | grep -v peruser | awk '{sum+=$1} END {printf("\n%.0fMB total RSS\n", sum/1024)}'
	(ps -u $USER -o pid | awk '{ print "grep Private_Dirty /proc/"$1"/smaps" }' | sh | awk '{ sum += $2 } END { printf("%.0fMB total Private Dirty RSS\n\n", sum/1024) }') 2>/dev/null

You will see that your actual physical memory usage is much smaller than what rss
reports.

## Extras
The script `extra.sh` contains some additional goodies:

* Memcached
* PHP + spawn-fcgi
* Erlang
* CouchDB
